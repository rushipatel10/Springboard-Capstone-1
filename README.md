# Springboard-Capstone-1

# What problem am I trying to solve?
Chelsea FC would like to win more games. I would create a machine learning predictive model to predict a game by using player statistics and team statistics. To build this model I will  wrangle and clean a soccer set where I will be organizing players statistics, game predictions, and player skill sets. This statistical analysis will help Chelsea FC see which predictors will change the outcomes of each game.

# What data are you using?
The data I will be using is from the UEFA champions league website and online data from the EPL,  where I will be showing the statistics of all the teams, along with their substitutions, and individual player skill levels. I will be going back 10-20 years worth of seasons, collecting data from regular season matchups, FA cup matchups, and UEFA matchups, including group play.

# Outline
Collecting the data from the EPL website alongside the UEFA champions league api will allow enough data to be gathered to create a machine learning algorithm to predict how to increase the chances of Chelsea FC to win in every matchup. Using the data from the team alongside using individual player statistics should give a good model for which player will score the most and what efficiency. I plan on first retrieving the data and then organize it. I would analyze the data to understand the player's skill level and team output would affect the game output. After analyzing, I would create a machine learning model that will use these predictors to determine the outcome of each game.

# Deliverables
My deliverables for this project will be through the machine learning algorithm to predict the outcome of each game. The model will illustrate how the different predictors will affect the outcome of the game. They can use those predictions to enhance their strategy. I would then create a written report of how to go about increasing their chances of winning.
